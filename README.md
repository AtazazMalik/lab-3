# Lab 3 - Flutter & GitHub Practice

## ðŸ“… Date
May 9, 2025

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today

### âœ… Flutter
- How to create a Flutter UI using widgets like:
  - `RichText` with `TextSpan` to combine styles in one text block
  - `Icon` for showing star graphics
  - `AppBar` and `Scaffold` for screen structure
  - `Column` and `Center` for layout alignment
- Fixed common issues like:
  - Using `const` only when appropriate
  - Understanding widget tree formatting and code organization

### âœ… Git & GitHub
- Initialized a local Git repository inside my Flutter project
- Connected it to a GitHub remote repository:  
  `https://github.com/AtazazMalik/lab-3`
- Learned how to:
  - `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` changes
  - Resolve push errors when the remote isn't empty (by using `git pull --rebase` or `--force`)
- Gained a better understanding of version control in real projects

## ðŸš€ Outcome
Successfully pushed a working Flutter introduction app to GitHub, containing a styled introduction screen using `RichText` and UI elements.
